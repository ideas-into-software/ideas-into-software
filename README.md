# About this GitHub profile

Please keep in mind that:

 - GitHub is only one of many online version control tools – there are many other with which I work, both online ( e.g. GitLab ) and offline ( companies’ internal version control tools, etc. )
 - only activities ( commits, PRs, discussions, etc. ) done as part of open-source projects / contributed to open-source projects and public repositories on GitHub only will be visible on this GitHub profile
 - no activities ( commits, PRs, discussions, etc. ) done as part of commercial projects / in private repositories on GitHub will be visible, neither those done outside GitHub ( using different version control tool )
 - I have tenths of repositories on this GitHub profile, but GitHub limits number of pinned repositories to 6, that is why you will only see 6 of those in “Pinned” section of this profile

Due to above mentioned, activities available on my GitHub profile provide only a limited view of my software engineering work – for more detailed information always refer to CV, also my company website’s “Case studies” section <https://ideas.into.software/case-studies/> which features a subset of projects I worked on over the years.
